Haskell is a black cat with a white patch under his chin, and a white patch on
his belly. He was born on May 12th 2019. As a kitten, he was incredibly naïve
and believed that everyone wanted what was best for him. As a result, he would
follow people into their homes, if possible. Nowadays he spends his outdoor time
elsewhere. Haskell is significantly larger than his sister, [Ada](/ada).

Haskell likes to cuddle with everyone, and is fond of eating on both facial hair
and any longer hair on people's heads, if offered the chance. His signature move
is to jump into somebody's lap and then crawl his way up to their left shoulder.
When he is hungry, he will approach us meowing and then try to climb up our
legs.

Haskell is named after famous logician and mathematician, [Haskell Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry).
