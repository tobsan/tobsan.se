# Bio

I live in a small town called Bohus outside Gothenburg with my wife, Lina, and
two cats [Ada](/ada) and [Haskell](/haskell). We enjoy poking around in our
garden, growing vegetables and flowers.

I was born in 1988, grew up outside Gothenburg, and studied at the University of
Gothenburg between 2006 and 2014. Since then, I've been working as a software
engineer.

I have had an interest of rhythm based music games since 2003, when I was introduced to Dance Dance
Revolution (DDR). I have tried a variety of similar games, and although I'm most proficient in DDR
(I even got a 9th place in the Swedish tournament 2005!), my favourite game is definitely Beatmania
IIDX. Perhaps the only such game I don't like is Guitar Hero, mainly because of its lack of timing
steps (and the fact that I've never become very good at it).

Other than that, I enjoy both table tennis and hiking, although I don't tend to do either very often
these days.

# What I do

I work as a software engineer, mostly with embedded programming. I have a master's degree in
computer science from the [University of Gothenburg](https://gu.se). During my studies I also worked
full-time with various students' union assignments.

# Random "skills"

* I tend to remember LOTS of quotes from movies, songs, sketches etc that I see.
* I used to be able to recite pi to 45 decimal places. Now probably something like 25
* Since 2008 I'm using svdvorak as my main keyboard layout
