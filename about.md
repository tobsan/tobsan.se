# Professional skills

I work at [Pelagicore](http://pelagicore.com), writing C++, Qt/QML and doing
[Yocto](http://yoctoproject.org) stuff most of the time during the days. I have a master's degree in
computer science from the [University of Gothenburg](http://gu.se).

I do enjoy functional programming more than the typical C++ stuff, but that usually ends up being
prioritized for hobby projects. I enjoy a higher-order languages, algorithmic challenges and a
message passing programming style without shared memory, as employed in erlang.

Programming aside, I have extensive experience with leading both small organizations, such as a
table tennis team, and larger ones, such as the [third largest students' union in
Sweden](http://gota.gu.se) (representing 18000+ students at the time). Perhaps the most useful
learning outcome of working with creating and altering policies has been my ability to read and
analyze large portions of texts in a short period of time, and the ability to put together many
different opinions in order to move forward.

# Random skills

* I tend to remember LOTS of quotes from movies, songs, sketches etc that I see.
* I used to be able to recite pi to 45 decimal places. Now probably something like 25
* Since 2008 I'm using svdvorak as my main keyboard layout

# Bio

Born in 1988, I grew up just outside Gothenburg, Sweden, attending school in Gr√•bo and Lerum. I
began studying computer science at the University of Gothenburg in 2006, and between 2010 and 2013 I
worked full-time at the students' unions at the university, which spawned a greater interest in
politics. I'm especially interested in issues regarding higher education and equality, and in
general I would identify as a socialist.

I have had an interest of rhythm based music games since 2003, when I was introduced to Dance Dance
Revolution (DDR). I have tried a variety of similar games, and although I'm most proficient in DDR
(I even got a 9th place in the Swedish tournament 2005!), my favourite game is definitely Beatmania
IIDX. Perhaps the only such game I don't like is Guitar Hero, mainly because of its lack of timing
steps (and the fact that I've never become very good at it).

Other than that, I enjoy both table tennis and hiking, although I don't tend to do either very often
these days.
