# Bio

Born in 1988, I grew up just outside Gothenburg, Sweden, attending school in Gr√•bo and Lerum. I
began studying computer science at the University of Gothenburg in 2006, and between 2010 and 2013 I
worked full-time at the students' unions at the university, which spawned a greater interest in
politics. I'm especially interested in issues regarding higher education and equality, and in
general I would identify as a socialist.

While I do software development for work, I also enjoy programming recreationally, where I tend to
do mostly Haskell or other functional languages. I enjoy a higher-order languages, algorithmic
challenges and a message passing programming style without shared memory, as employed in erlang.

I have had an interest of rhythm based music games since 2003, when I was introduced to Dance Dance
Revolution (DDR). I have tried a variety of similar games, and although I'm most proficient in DDR
(I even got a 9th place in the Swedish tournament 2005!), my favourite game is definitely Beatmania
IIDX. Perhaps the only such game I don't like is Guitar Hero, mainly because of its lack of timing
steps (and the fact that I've never become very good at it).

Other than that, I enjoy both table tennis and hiking, although I don't tend to do either very often
these days.

# What I do

I work as a software engineer, mostly with embedded programming, doing
[Yocto](https://yoctoproject.org) stuff most of the time during the days. I have a master's degree in
computer science from the [University of Gothenburg](https://gu.se). During my studies I also worked
full-time with various students' union assignments.

# Random "skills"

* I tend to remember LOTS of quotes from movies, songs, sketches etc that I see.
* I used to be able to recite pi to 45 decimal places. Now probably something like 25
* Since 2008 I'm using svdvorak as my main keyboard layout
