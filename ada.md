Ada is a tiger striped cat, who is significantly smaller than her brother,
[Haskell](/haskell). She was born on May 12th 2019. She is the cautious type but
will flirt with anyone when she's outdoors. She repeatedly sneaks in to our
neighbors house and tries to eat their cat's food. Ada is very particular about
who gets to pet her and when, but she enjoys hunting prey and sticks. She also
enjoys stealing any prey that Haskell has brought in.

Ada is named after famous programmer and mathematician, [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace).
