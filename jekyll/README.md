My personal wobsite
-------------------
I'm trying to keep track of all incarnations of personal web pages
I have had throughout the years. Hopefully this will serve that purpose
well.

The current web page (2017-11-12) is available in the gh-pages branch. That
branch uses Jekyll which GitHub supports automatically.
