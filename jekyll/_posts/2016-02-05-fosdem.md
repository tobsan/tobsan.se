Last weekend was [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org), a large conference for free and
open source software developers. I went there with a couple of colleagues from
Pelagicore and we had a great time! Lots of good technical talks, some quite
bad talks, and a heartwarming story from the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://hotosm.org/)
about their mapping work as crisis response. If you missed it, most talks
were recorded and will be available on the FOSDEM site.
