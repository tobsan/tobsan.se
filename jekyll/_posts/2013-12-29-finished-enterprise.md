I just finished watching the last episode of Star Trek: Enterprise, which I must say has been a
disappointment, although the last episode was sort of nostalgic. Guess that's what you get for
having to do everything inside of four seasons, where one season is completely devoted to the stupid
[Xindi war](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Xindi_incident).
