It's been a while since I updated here. I still have plans for a nicer structure
of this site, but as most other things, it's been a dorment project lately. I am
however planning to move this server to some new hardware. I realized my old
Core 2 Quad from 2007 with equally old mobo, memory etc etc is neither fast
nor environmentally friendly anymore. With that in mind, I bought a [motherboard
from Supermicro](http://www.supermicro.com/products/motherboard/celeron/x10/x10sba.cfm)
that has a built-in low-power CPU, support for HW RAID and should total no more
than 20W (including disk drives) when up and running. I'm using an old subwoofer
from a [2.1 speaker system](https://www.komplett.se/logitech-z523-dark-hgtalarset/485423) 
I used to use. Given that the subwoofer's inner dimensions are about 20cm and the
motherboard is a m-ITX one, it's a tight build. When it's all finished, I will
post some photos of it here.
