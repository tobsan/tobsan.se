I were at St Paul's Rodeo tonight with some colleagues. It was really fun, but
at the same time it was really male-dominated, white and so on, which of course
had an impact on the atmosphere. It was still fun, and it was probably the most
american thing I've done so far.

Also, it was the first time since I got my driver's licence that I actually drove
somewhere, and it was in the US of all places. Except for taking somebody else's 
parking spot, I think I did fine.
