I have submitted my thesis to the department, and is currently waiting for my examiner to
approve/reject it. In the mean time, I'm looking for a job, preferrably as a systems developer, so
if you know of something, let me know! Also: the sixth season of Star Trek: The Next Generation will
be released on Blu-Ray soon, make sure to watch it!
