It is my birthday, and I'm now 26 years old. The major change this will have on my life is that I
will have to pay full price on the public transport. Other than that, I've been watching a lot of
Continuum lately, a series that was quite slow the first two seasons, but as of the third season,
it's really getting interesting with all time travel stuff.
