Today, for the first time in my life, I tried some
[surströmming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surstr%C3%B6mming) with a couple of friends.
I must say I'm positively surprised. While it smells truly terrible, the taste was not
so bad, and was mostly salt with a hint of something undescribable. We ate it on crisp
flat bread with butter, potatoes, onion and sour cream.
