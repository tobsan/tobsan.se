So my thoughts about Happstack are still there, but is not under active
development. In other news I just watched the trailer for the upcoming season
of the walking dead, and it looks good!

I also reinstalled Debian on this server, and on my desktop (it was previously
running Ubuntu), and I combined my storage disks into a RAID setup as well. I'm
still not convinced of what is the best way to share the media to other
devices. I have rygel running as a DLNA server and currently I mount the
storage dir over sshfs to my desktop, but is that best? I used to do it over
NFS before, and perhaps that is reasonable.

Tomorrow is election day here in Sweden. I'm very much hoping for a change of
government (with a strong socialist party), an end to the racists position as
weigher and an introduction of the feminist initiative into the riksdag.
Although the social democrats have been looking like a bad copy of the
conservatives lately, they still have a better ideology to build on, so I guess
that's somethingâ€¦ That said, I'm worried that this will not be the case when
all votes are counted. Worst case scenario is that the Alliance parties become
larger than the rest, but still needing the support of the racists (who are
looking to get upwards of 10% of the votes :/), giving them much more
influence.
