So it took a while for me to update this when I moved. I replaced the server
running this website with serving it through GitHub, and at the same time, the
HDD with the actual data on it got packed into some box somewhere.

The good news is: I found the HDD! I don't expect a lot to change when it comes
to this site in the near future, but at least we're on some kind of status quo
here.

As for the ideas on migrating the server to a low-powered version, I actually
did that, but that server isn't serving this site. Instead, I use it for
staying online on IRC etc.

Also, the apartment me and my girlfriend are now living together in was really
as good as it seemed, with lots of light and a large balcony. Being newly
built, it is very expensive, which I would say is the only downside.
