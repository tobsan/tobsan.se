Nice news, me and my girlfriend are moving in together! Rare as
they come, I got a contract for a rented apartment here in Gothenburg, through
the internal queue that my landlord has. We'll move in on July 1st, and I hope
it will be as nice at is looks on the plans (it's a newly built apartment).

All my impressions from Thailand are also starting to sink in. It truly is a
wonderful place for vacation. I hope that I will be able to go back there more
than once, for both relaxing and recreation.
