I'm trying to keep track of all incarnations of personal web pages
I have had throughout the years. Hopefully this will serve that purpose
well.

My current web page (2015-08-24) is the one in the angular/ directory. For
the sake of just keeping code rather than content, I've removed links and
blog posts etc etc. 

I hope to be able to switch to a much cooler page I'm writing using Happstack.
