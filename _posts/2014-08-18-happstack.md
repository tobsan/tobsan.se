I'm just starting to look at [Happstack](http://happstack.com) (a Haskell web server framework.
Let's face it, editing the HTML of this site by hand is getting a bit tedious. Writing something in
Haskell that is actually going to be practical will also be fun. At least a "site" and "blog" part
will be in this new "webapp" that I'm developing. Stay tuned.

**Update as of 2017-11-12**: I found a system for avoiding having to write HTML by hand, called
Jekyll.
