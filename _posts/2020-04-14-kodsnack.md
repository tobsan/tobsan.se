Together with the rest of the guys from [foss-north](https://foss-north.se), I participated in the
Swedish podcast [kodsnack](https://kodsnack.se) recently, talking about licenses and why copyleft is
a good thing.

If you enjoy listening to a bunch of guys rambling on for more than an hour about free software
licenses, check out [episode 360](https://kodsnack.se/360) through your favourite podcast player.
