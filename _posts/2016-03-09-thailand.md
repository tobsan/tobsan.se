The plan to migrate the server was, as usual, shot to pieces by something
such as laziness. I'm currently in Thailand for the first time in my life.
Air temp is 35 celcius, water temp is 27 celcius, so things could definitely
be worse. I feel like the typical tourist, which is unusual for me, but this
time it's just about relaxing, and making sure that doing nothing is
everything I thought it could be.
