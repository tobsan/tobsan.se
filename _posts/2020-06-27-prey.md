title:  How much do cats kill?

Since mid-march, our cats have been allowed to be outdoors, which is great. They are still young,
but their instincts for killing prey are well developed. This made me think of [this
comic](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/cats_actually_kill) by the oatmeal about how much cats kill.

Here's a not-so-comprehensive list of what they have killed so far:

* A squirrel
* A vole
* A magpie
* A small snake (Anguis Fragilis)

* Various smaller birds (mostly juveniles)
* Countless small mice

A drawback of working from home is that we get a lot of these prey presented to us, either in the
morning in the form of a corpse, or some time between morning and lunch usually, sometimes in the
form of a living mouse. Fortunately for us, both cats are crazy about showing off, so they will meow
loudly to get our attention to what they've caught.
