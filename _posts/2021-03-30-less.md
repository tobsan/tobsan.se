[less (1)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/less.1.html) is a truly great
tool for paging text. I use it mainly to read log files and any other text files
that I think are too long to [cat (1)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html).
It is also used as the default pager for man pages, so whenever you read a man
page, it will be displayed using less.

Less can take a bunch of command-line options, which you can also enter while
running less (like typing -i to make searches case-insensitive). However, less
also reads an environment variable called LESS. This is very convenient, so in
my shell, I've set the following:

```
$ echo $LESS
IRXN
```

These options are the same as the command line options, so what these particular
options sets are (interpreted from what the man page says):
* I = case insensitive search
* R = allow ANSI color control characters
* X = don't clear the screen when starting less
* N = add line numbers

Very handy indeed, now my man pages are line numbered, but the most useful thing
is the case insensitive search, which I didn't know about before!
