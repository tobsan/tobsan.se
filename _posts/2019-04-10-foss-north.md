Just coming home from the last day of [FOSS-North](https://foss-north.se/), this year's event was
great but exhausting. I had a more active role this year helping out with keeping schedule,
directing visitors etc, but I also took part in the training on [shared
libraries](http://man7.org/training/shlib/index.html) that was today.

These are my highlights of [this year's talks](https://foss-north.se/2019/speakers-and-talks.html):
* Reducing boot-time on Linux devices by Chris Simmonds
* Understanding user namespaces by Michael Kerrisk
* Saving the Day by Stack Smashing a Hundred Streetlights before Sunrise by Adam Dunkels

If you only want to see some of the talks once the videos come up, these are the ones I say were
most interesting or best.
