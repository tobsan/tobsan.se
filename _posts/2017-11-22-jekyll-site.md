The site got a major re-vamp now that I finally switched to using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
something I got inspired into doing from my job, where [pelux.io](http://pelux.io) is written using
Jekyll.

Lots of things that was on my TODO are now fixed:
* Permalinks to all blog posts
* Pages that are not blog posts are easily available
* Not all pages has to be listed in the main menu
* It looks much better, really.

What I'd like to do for future updates is to have different blog streams, perhaps like
[Jeena](http://jeena.net) does it with notes, images and posts, or perhaps just a specialized blog
stream for a specific subject, such as programming. I assume the ``categories`` field in these pages
will serve that purpose quite well, but it would be nice if it was possible to just add another
stream, so that I could have any categories there as well, for example.

I would like to have an RSS feed, and I suppose there are plugins in Jekyll for that. Since it's a
static site generator, it would just regenerate the feed, which should be no biggie.
