My time in Portland is coming to an end in a week, and it is with somewhat mixed
feelings I will leave the US. While I would never really want to live here for
various reasons, it is a place I would like to learn more about. There is so much
to see and so much to do. I will probably come back here for vacation some time,
although not neccessarily focusing on Portland.

That said, I miss the "normal" things of Sweden. The bad weather, the good news
reports, the cheese and of course most people I know. I'm still starting to agree
with my colleague Jeena, who pointed out that things are not so different here
as one would think. At least so it seems as long as one does not dig deeper into
issues.
