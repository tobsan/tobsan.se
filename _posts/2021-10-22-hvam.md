I recently managed to score [99.70](/assets/hvam/99.70.jpg) on the infamous HVAM. I've had a love/hate
relationship with this song ever since the days of DS EuroMix 2 that Liseberg
had back in 2003.

While 99.70 isn't an exceptional score on most older DDR songs, HVAM is a song
that nobody really likes, because it is riddled with double-steps. However, as
I've come to realize, it's not that many double-steps as most players may think.
Let's go through the chart, and ofc I mean the single expert chart.

I got the graphics for the chart from [ddrfreak](http://www.ddrfreak.com/stepcharts/stepchart.php?song=healing2&mode=Single&difficulty=Maniac&code=Normal&Submit=Submit). You can download the [full
annotated chart](/assets/hvam/hvam-annotated.png) as well, or just keep reading.

## Beginning, double-steps!
I've tried to make some kind of sense of the beginning of HVAM, but it's just
double-steps **all the way**. From an FA perspective, this is the hardest part
of the whole song.

I didn't annotate this part of the chart because seriously, it's just double
steps, nothing to learn here, just pain.

## Jumps
I find the hardest thing about these jumps before the chorus to keep cool and
not be early. Other than that, there is nothing special about them.

## Chorus or whatever
This part has no double steps at all, provided that you start each run on the
correct foot. There are a couple of cross-overs but that's it. I've annotated
this chart, as below. And while HVAM certainly **is** full of double-steps, the
chorus part contains really nice cross-overs.

## Post-chorus and jumps
This whole part you can play like a normal person and be stressed about the
jumps. You can do a cross-over just after the two down notes in a row, as well!

## End stream
The end stream is just a single long stream of notes where there is a
double-step on every 16th note, coinciding with the hospital-like beep in the
song. Don't double-step on any other notes than these, and you'll be fine.
