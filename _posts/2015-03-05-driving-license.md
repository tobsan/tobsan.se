Last Monday I got my driver's license. Funny how things change when your life change.
When I was 16, I started to practice for this license, and then after I graduated
from high school, I moved from my parents' house (and as a consequence: from the
car I was practicing with) and it all sorta stopped. Back then I was rather motivated
and me and my dad were driving quite a lot. Then I took it up again about a year ago.

It was interesting to see that I did not remember almost anything from how to drive
but also my motivation was much smaller. Living in Gothenburg has its benefits from
fast and cheap public transportation with mainly trams and buses. I realize now that
if I had tried harder and been more motivated, I could've managed to do it all in
three months time probably, instead of 12 months. Anyway, it's a good thing to know
how to drive.

Also: I today realized how much weaker the support for custom things like macros and
functions are in qmake compared to cmake. Qmake has its benefits, sure, but when
it takes half a day to get some code generation to work, then one of us surely has
got a problem.

One last thing: I got a Guitar Hero guitar and some games, so finally I will be
able to master that game! So far I can manage rather well on medium, or whatever
the difficulty just above easy is called.
