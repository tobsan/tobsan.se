So, we bought a house. It's large, has a funny garden and also floor heating in many rooms, super
cozy! We also got two kittens (Haskell and Ada), that wreak havoc around the house in regular
intervals. I expect I will be updating here less frequently for the forseeable future.

UPDATE: Oh, and we got two cats, [Ada](/ada) and [Haskell](/haskell).
