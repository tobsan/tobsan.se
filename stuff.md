# Stuff I've written
This page is part bragging, part just a stash of things that won't fit the blogging part.

## Programming
* Implementing incremental and parallel parsing, my master's thesis.
* YANE - Yet Another NES Emulator, my bachelor's thesis.
* Tourettes, a torrent tracker written in erlang.
* A simple Brainfuck interpreter in Haskell.
* My profile on GitHub.
* My (old) .vimrc

## Other
* Humanistisk forskning för dödskamp, an article on how the government's
  politics on research funding affects studies of (foreign) languages. (in
  Swedish).
* My speech at the inauguration of new professors at the University of
  Gothenburg 2013. (in Swedish).
