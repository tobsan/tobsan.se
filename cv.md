I'm a software engineer, working primarily with embedded systems, and I have a
passion for functional programming. I believe in free and open source software,
and I try to contribute to it as much as I can.

I also enjoy playing rhythm-based games whenever I can, such as Dance Dance
Revolution, Beatmania IIDX and similar games. Timing is everything.

## Software skills

I can program in more or less any language, Iâ€™ve sampled most different
paradigms. Languages I have most experience with are C++, Python, Haskell, Java,
Bash, Erlang. Professionally I have mostly written C++, Python, Bash and QML.

I feel at home in a small team of experts, preferrably following some agile
setting. I work exclusively in GNU/Linux environments. I don't like Windows, but
I can use it if I must. I'm a dvorak typist since 2008. I'm a native swede and
speak english fluently.
