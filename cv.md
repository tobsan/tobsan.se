I'm a software engineer, working primarily with embedded systems, and I have a passion for
functional programming. I believe in free and open source software, and I try to contribute to it as
much as I can.

I also enjoy playing rhythm-based games whenever I can, such as Dance Dance Revolution, Beatmania
IIDX and similar games. Timing is everything.

## Software skills

I can program in more or less any language, I’ve sampled most different paradigms. Languages I have
most experience with are C++, Python, Haskell, Java, Bash, Erlang. Professionally I have mostly
written C++, Python, Bash and QML.

I feel at home in a small team of experts, preferrably following some agile setting. I work
exclusively in GNU/Linux environments, but I can find my way around a Windows system. I'm a dvorak
typist since 2008. I'm a native swede and speak english fluently.

#### Tools and frameworks
