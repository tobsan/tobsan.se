My personal wobsite
-------------------
I'm trying to keep track of all incarnations of personal web pages
I have had throughout the years. Hopefully this will serve that purpose
well.

The current web page (2017-11-20) is available in the gh-pages branch. The
code that serves it is about the same as the one in jekyll/ on the master
branch. 

Future plans
------------
<del>I hope to be able to switch to a much cooler page I'm writing using Happstack.</del>
