So it took a while for me to update this when I moved. I replaced the server
running this website with serving it through GitHub, and at the same time, the
HDD with the actual data on it got packed into some box somewhere.

The good news is: I found the HDD! I don't expect a lot to change when it comes
to this site in the near future, but at least we're on some kind of status quo
here.

As for the ideas on migrating the server to a low-powered version, I actually
did that, but that server isn't serving this site. Instead, I use it for 
staying online on IRC etc.

Also, the apartment me and my girlfriend are now living together in was really
as good as it seemed, with lots of light and a large balcony. Being newly
built, it is very expensive, which I would say is the only downside.

Nice news, me and my girlfriend are moving in together! Rare as
they come, I got a contract for a rented apartment here in Gothenburg, through
the internal queue that my landlord has. We'll move in on July 1st, and I hope
it will be as nice at is looks on the plans (it's a newly built apartment).

All my impressions from Thailand are also starting to sink in. It truly is a
wonderful place for vacation. I hope that I will be able to go back there more
than once, for both relaxing and recreation.

The plan to migrate the server was, as usual, shot to pieces by something
such as laziness. I'm currently in Thailand for the first time in my life.
Air temp is 35 celcius, water temp is 27 celcius, so things could definitely
be worse. I feel like the typical tourist, which is unusual for me, but this
time it's just about relaxing, and making sure that doing nothing is
everything I thought it could be.

Last weekend was [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org), a large conference for free and
open source software developers. I went there with a couple of colleagues from
Pelagicore and we had a great time! Lots of good technical talks, some quite
bad talks, and a heartwarming story from the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://hotosm.org/)
about their mapping work as crisis response. If you missed it, most talks
were recorded and will be available on the FOSDEM site.

Happy New Year! I have a week off from work this week, and my plan is to
migrate all data from this server to the one I bought more than a year ago.
Hopefully, I will soon be running tobsan.se from a much nicer and more
low-powered computer :).

Two things: 

- I've met a lovely lady.
- I'm involved in a really cool project at work. My QML skills are constantly increasing.

That's all for now, I'm afraid.

Last saturday, I had a traditional Swedish kräftskiva (crayfish party) at my place.
We had crayfish, drank nubbe and had a good time!

Today, for the first time in my life, I tried some
[surströmming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surstr%C3%B6mming) with a couple of friends.
I must say I'm positively surprised. While it smells truly terrible, the taste was not
so bad, and was mostly salt with a hint of something undescribable. We ate it on crip
flat bread with butter, potatoes, onion and sour cream.

My time in Portland is coming to an end in a week, and it is with somewhat mixed
feelings I will leave the US. While I would never really want to live here for
various reasons, it is a place I would like to learn more about. There is so much
to see and so much to do. I will probably come back here for vacation some time,
although not neccessarily focusing on Portland.

That said, I miss the "normal" things of Sweden. The bad weather, the good news
reports, the cheese and of course most people I know. I'm still starting to agree
with my colleague Jeena, who pointed out that things are not so different here
as one would think. At least so it seems as long as one does not dig deeper into
issues.

I were at St Paul's Rodeo tonight with some colleagues. It was really fun, but
at the same time it was really male-dominated, white and so on, which of course
had an impact on the atmosphere. It was still fun, and it was probably the most
american thing I've done so far.

Also, it was the first time since I got my driver's licence that I actually drove
somewhere, and it was in the US of all places. Except for taking somebody else's 
parking spot, I think I did fine.

It's been a while since I updated here. Some things that have happened since last
update. I'm currently working on a project at work with a client in the US, which
has given me the opportunity to see that country (I've never been there before).

The US surely is a strange country, and Portland, OR too. From not being completely
ignorant about the world, I already knew some stuff about it of course, but you
tend to see the smaller things once you're there.

* The dollar notes all look the same.
* Most toilets use a shitload (pun intended!) of water.
* Data traffic is apparently really expensive.
* Here you can actually get all combinations of coke variants, like coke vanilla
  zero or diet cherry coke.

I've also been on vacation for two weeks. Me and my brother went to Kefalonia in
Greece and enjoyed 14 days of doing nothing, eating gyros, drinking milkshakes
and taking the occational swim in the ocean. The highlights for me was looking at
the cool sea turtles in Argostoli, and having a great grilled kalamari lunch there.

I still haven't migrated from my old Core 2 Quad server to the newer J1800-based
one.

UPDATE: The stuff that are being advertised on TV here is ridiculous and plays very
well into the stereotypical image of americans.

Last Monday I got my driver's license. Funny how things change when your life change.
When I was 16, I started to practice for this license, and then after I graduated
from high school, I moved from my parents' house (and as a consequence: from the
car I was practicing with) and it all sorta stopped. Back then I was rather motivated
and me and my dad were driving quite a lot. Then I took it up again about a year ago.

It was interesting to see that I did not remember almost anything from how to drive
but also my motivation was much smaller. Living in Gothenburg has its benefits from
fast and cheap public transportation with mainly trams and buses. I realize now that
if I had tried harder and been more motivated, I could've managed to do it all in
three months time probably, instead of 12 months. Anyway, it's a good thing to know
how to drive.

Also: I today realized how much weaker the support for custom things like macros and
functions are in qmake compared to cmake. Qmake has its benefits, sure, but when
it takes half a day to get some code generation to work, then one of us surely has
got a problem.

One last thing: I got a Guitar Hero guitar and some games, so finally I will be
able to master that game! So far I can manage rather well on medium, or whatever
the difficulty just above easy is called.

I wrote a public note on my facebook page in Swedish about my local union of

It's been a while since I updated here. I still have plans for a nicer structure
of this site, but as most other things, it's been a dorment project lately. I am
however planning to move this server to some new hardware. I realized my old
Core 2 Quad from 2007 with equally old mobo, memory etc etc is neither fast
nor environmentally friendly anymore. With that in mind, I bought a [motherboard
from Supermicro](http://www.supermicro.com/products/motherboard/celeron/x10/x10sba.cfm)
that has a built-in low-power CPU, support for HW RAID and should total no more
than 20W (including disk drives) when up and running. I'm using an old subwoofer
from a [2.1 speaker system](https://www.komplett.se/logitech-z523-dark-hgtalarset/485423) 
I used to use. Given that the subwoofer's inner dimensions are about 20cm and the
motherboard is a m-ITX one, it's a tight build. When it's all finished, I will
post some photos of it here.

Just watched the last episode of LOST, and let me tell you: don't do it. If you
have not yet watched LOST but are planning to do so, just watch the first
season, or maybe the first through third seasons, but the fourth to sixth seasons
were just a big waste of time. Just a lot of bullcrap and no closure what so ever.
That being said, I just deleted my whole LOST directory, so that I never have to
watch that crap again. I was however told of [Chronologically LOST]
(http://www.chronologicallylost.com/2011/02/series.html) which seems nice, but I
don't think I'll be watching it any time soon anyway...

Speaking of TV series, there are new seasons running for both Big Bang Theory and
The Walking Dead, both of which I'm following. Still waiting for any news
regarding Continuum, I've read that the last season of Star Trek TNG will be
released to Blu-ray on Dec 6th, so I've got that to wait for at least :).

I recently read an interesting blog post about the banking app Swish. Check it out
[here](http://blog.nullbyte.eu/open-curtains-in-swish-payments-service/). Also, it
seems that Swish [uses GPL'ed libraries](https://www.facebook.com/getswish/posts/10152347980456949)
in their app, but they refuse to release the source code for it. My advice is:
**don't use Swish**. Also, as part of my work, I've contributed for the first
time to some real open source project, namely the Yocto project. Check out [my patch]
(https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/meta/classes/spdx.bbclass?id=f348071efd9419de3fa7f4e4ad78dfa5f8445412)
for the SPDX bbclass. [SPDX](http://www.spdx.org) is a standard for describing
software licenses for files (sort of). We use the Yocto project to build a custom
embedded Linux-based platform.

Update 2014-11-20: Another patch by me was accepted for the same class, yay!

I'm working on migrating the content of this page to only using markdown. Currently, 
I have no pure JS parser for it to HTML, but I'm looking into using Node.js instead 
of lighttpd, which would be able to provide that functionality.

UPDATE 2014-10-19: I found a small Markdown parser in pure JS
[here](http://pzxc.com/simple-javascript-markdown-parsing-function).

I'd like to write some things about crowdsourcing activities. Since 2011, 
I've been part of the moderating team for translating Twitter into Swedish,
being part of the very beginning, together with a couple of other swedes. It
sure has been interesting, and I sure feel quite proud about the efforts we 
made populating the basic grammar, deciding what "tweet" should be in Swedish
(FYI: the verb is "tweeta" in its basic form). The decisions we made were seen 
by anyone who uses Twitter in Swedish, which was kind of cool.

The Twitter Translation Center (TTC) is a crowdsourced effort for translations. 
This means that while we were a couple of guys moderating translations and 
having final say, most of the translating was done by regular Twitter users. 
Our job was usually to take the translation with the most votes, and select it
as the final one (if it was good, but they usually were).

After a while, Twitter introduced the use of a JIRA tracker to keep track of new
phrases that were imported and needed to be translated. That was good, because
most (90%+) of the system was already translated, so keeping track of new 
additions was a welcome change. Later however, more and more strings were 
exclusive to moderators only (due to secrecy and releases and whatnot), and more 
and more strings became "ultra-priority" which were also only available to 
moderators, and also very much ASAP tasks. This is where I believe it stopped
being fun for me. 

I believe that for a system like this, having hard deadlines is totally out of 
the picture, as long as you don't pay someone for their job (Twitter did send 
me some t-shirts etc, but that doesn't really count). The whole point of having
a crowdsourced translation is that it is a collective process that grows in a 
more or less organic manner. To be frank, too many and too sharp deadlines 
spoils the fun of it. I have enough deadlines in my job as a software engineer,
if I wanted to feel the same in my spare time, I'd rather just work longer 
hours. I think, that part of the *point* with working with crowdsourcing 
is that things have to take time. It *should* be slow, and I really mean slow.

It might seem ironic that I don't think there should be any pressure on 
volunteers in this case, having worked for a long time in the students' union 
and all, but let me be clear: that is a completely different thing. Within the
students' union, or any other association, every member is equal, and have a say
when it comes to the goals and activities of that association. Twitter on the 
other hand, is a company, meaning that their main goal is to create profit for
their owners, and volunteering as a translator does not give you a say about 
anything, apart from the translations you're approving or rejecting. That is
the fundamental difference, and that is why I think one can expect more from 
someone who volunteers for an association than someone who works for free, just
for the fun of it, for Twitter.

So goodbye TTC, it really have been a pleasure, but in the end
it just did not work out.

Yesterday, I went to all the stations in the Gothenburg tram network. It took a total of eight
hours, of which approx. one hour was waiting time. I really wish there were more cycles in the
network, because right now one basically has to go to the end station and then back almost to the
city center, before being able to go in another direction. Although Kålltorp and Östra
Sjukhuset is a good example of an existing cycle.

Also, the election did not went very well. While it looks like we will have a government based on
the social democrats and the green party, the socialist party did not win lots of new votes
(totaling 5.72%), and the racist party grew to almost 13%.  Also the feminist initiative did not
make the cut for riksdag, they got 3.12% of the votes. The coming four years will not be fun to
watch, I'm telling you. I hope that we together can start talking about the more ideological issues
with everyone, making it clearer what the differences are between left and right, and showing
everyone, both with ideology and with real policy making, that the racists have no basis for their
politics. Only then can we create a better society for everyone. You can check out the election
results [here](http://www.val.se/val/val2014/slutresultat/R/rike/index.html).

So my thoughts about Happstack are still there, but is not under active development. In other news I
just watched the trailer for the upcoming season of the walking dead, and it looks good!

I also reinstalled Debian on this server, and on my desktop (it was previously running Ubuntu), and
I combined my storage disks into a RAID setup as well. I'm still not convinced of what is the best
way to share the media to other devices. I have rygel running as a DLNA server and currently I mount
the storage dir over sshfs to my desktop, but is that best? I used to do it over NFS before, and
perhaps that is reasonable.

Tomorrow is election day here in Sweden. I'm very much hoping for a change of government (with a
strong socialist party), an end to the racists position as weigher and an introduction of the
feminist initiative into the riksdag. Although the social democrats have been looking like a bad
copy of the conservatives lately, they still have a better ideology to build on, so I guess that's
something... That said, I'm worried that this will not be the case when all votes are counted. Worst
case scenario is that the Alliance parties become larger than the rest, but still needing the
support of the racists (who are looking to get upwards of 10% of the votes :/), giving them much
more influence.

I'm just starting to look at Happstack (a Haskell web server framework. Let's face it, editing the
HTML of this site by hand is getting a bit tedious. Writing something in Haskell that is actually
going to be practical will also be fun. At least a "site" and "blog" part will be in this new
"webapp" that I'm developing. Stay tuned.

Server is back up after a crash of sorts. Apparently, it is a bad idea to reboot the server that
serves you NFS shares while watching some TV series served from said NFS share. The result is that
my 3TB drive now believes it is only 800 GB, and I'm unable to mount any file system on it, since
the file system is configured for 3TB. Also, when troubleshooting the usage of a graphics card,
remember to have all your RAM modules firmly in place, or you may not get any graphics output at
all.

UPDATE: The disk is now fully functional again, and as far as I can tell by playing some random
media files from it, nothing has been lost. Since I suspect more people will have this problem,
here's what I did in the end. The problem I had was that the disk somehow believed itself to be
smaller than its actual size. Since the partition table and file system on the drive were set to its
actual size, this made it impossible to do anything before fixing this problem, since a new file
system (for example) would mean losing all data. Here goes:

1. Make sure your kernel has support for IDE_TASK_IOCTL since this is used by hdparm for what you're about to do
2. Call *hdparm --yes-i-know-what-i-am-doing --dco-restore /dev/sdX/*. Note that this command is marked as dangerous in the manual, so use at your own risk. It makes kind of a factory reset for the basic disk values, but it does not erase any data, really. In my session hdparm reported I/O error when issuing the command, but it seems to have worked anyway.
3. Repartition the disk with gdisk or fdisk or whatever. Since my disk was a storage disk, I only had one big partition on it, so restoring that was easy.
4. Run a file system check, in my case *fsck.ext4*. For me at least, some values in the file system did not match, so fsck fixed those.
5. Mount the disk!

A log of what I did can be found [here](disklog.txt) I've edited out a couple of calls to *dmesg |
tail*, but I recommend anyone checking the status there regularly during such an operation. From
looking at the gdisk output in the log, you can see that I did overwrite my partition table with a
new one (746 GiB partition). I would advice against that, even if the partition tables doesn't touch
any data.

Continuum is getting more and more interesting the more I watch. I find it especially cool to see
how the view of the corporations vs liber8 glides both between timelines and between people/the
police/kiera in whichever timeline is active. Something I'm *really* looking forward to is the
Blu-Ray release of the last season of Star Trek TNG, which should be coming some time in the early
autumn!

Also, learning C++ has proven to be both interesting and weird.  While being powerful, the language
surely would benefit from being just C with OO+templates, but it's just so much more, and for what
reason?

Btw, I'm sort of looking for some kind of web publishing system that is lightweight but still can
support stuff like sharing, permalinking and the such, much like the notes system that my co-worker
[Jeena](http://jeena.net/notes/) has. Any pointers would be helpful.

2014-07-30

It is my birthday, and I'm now 26 years old. The major change this will have on my life is that I
will have to pay full price on the public transport. Other than that, I've been watching a lot of
Continuum lately, a series that was quite slow the first two seasons, but as of the third season,
it's really getting interesting with all time travel stuff.
